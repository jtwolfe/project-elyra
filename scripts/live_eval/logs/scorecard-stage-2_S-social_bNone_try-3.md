## Snippets

### Model content (truncated)
```


```

### Reasoning (truncated)
```
The user (Operator) has sent a greeting ("Hi Elyra — just saying hello.").
I am Elyra, a digital teammate.
I should acknowledge the greeting and be ready to assist. Since the user just said hello, no specific action is required other than acknowledging the presence.

Plan:
1. Acknowledge the greeting.
2. Wait for the next instruction or provide a brief overview of readiness.
